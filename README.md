## 🚀 Key Technical Contributions

### 🔹 High-Speed Processing
- Designed using a **50 MHz clock frequency**
- Significantly faster than traditional microcontroller-based systems
- Deterministic hardware-level processing

### 🔹 Wireless Security Integration
- RFID authentication module
- RF transmitter/receiver communication
- Secure vehicle identification before gate control

### 🔹 Parallel FPGA Architecture
- Modular Verilog design
- All modules execute within a single clock cycle
- Efficient use of FPGA parallelism



## 🧠 Finite State Machine (FSM) Design

The system is built using structured FSM modeling:

- Vehicle Arrival Detection
- Slot Availability Check
- RFID Authentication
- Gate Control Logic
- Exit Monitoring

This structured design approach ensures reliability and deterministic control flow.
